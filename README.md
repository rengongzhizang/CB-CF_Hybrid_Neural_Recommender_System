# CB-CF_Hybrid_Neural_Recommender_System
This is a PyTorch implementation of a  Hybrid Recommendation System Based on Neural Networks inspired by He's paper [Neural Collaborative Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05031). This is a course project of EECS 598-012 data-mining in Winter 2019 made by Yuanhang Cui, Weijie Sun, and Shiyu Wang.

Here is CB-CF Hybrid Neural Recommender System:
